# Project Overview:

  -  The backend part of the Hotel Booking App is responsible for handling business logic, data storage, and security. It uses MongoDB as the database to store users, hotels, bookings, and reviews. User authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and secure payments are processed via RazorPay or Stripe.

# Tech Stack:

   -  Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code.
   -  Express.js: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
   -  MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing data like users, bookings, and hotels.
   -  Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB.
   -  JWT: For secure user authentication.
   -  Bcrypt: For securely hashing user passwords.
   -  Stripe: Payment gateway for secure transactions.
   -  Cors: Middleware for handling cross-origin requests.
   -  Installation and Setup
   -  Prerequisites
   -  Node.js (v12+)
   -  MongoDB (Local or Cloud-based)
   
# Localhost :

   -  The backend server will be running on http://localhost:8800.

# API Endpoints:

  Endpoint	Method	Description:

   -  /api/auth/register    	                                          -     POST	Register a new user
   -  /api/auth/login                                             	   -     POST	Login a user and generate a token
   -  /api/hotels	                                                      -     GET	Retrieve a list of hotels
   -  /api/rooms	                                                      -     GET	Retrieve details of a specific hotel

# Security:

   -  JWT Authentication: Protects routes by ensuring only authenticated users can access them.
   -  Bcrypt Password Hashing: Ensures that user passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database.
   -  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Middleware is used to restrict access to certain features (e.g., admin can manage hotels).

# Deployment:

  The backend is deployed on Render. To deploy it on Render, follow these steps:

   -  Sign up for Render: Visit Render and create an account.
   -  Create Web Service: Select your backend repo (project-name-backend) and click New Web Service.
   -  Configure Settings:
         Build Command: npm install
         Start Command: npm start
   -  Set Environment Variables:
         MONGO_URI
         JWT_SECRET
         SECRECT_API_KEY
   -  Deploy: Click Create Web Service. Render will deploy your backend and provide a live URL for API use.
